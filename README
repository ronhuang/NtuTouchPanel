Log filename rules
==================

Every time the system boots up, a new log file will be created. The
filename will be TSxxx.LOG, where xxx ranges from 000 to 999. Upon
boot up, the system will scan the SD card and look for the next
available number, starting from 0.

So for example, if the card has no existing log file, TS000.LOG will
be created. If the SD card already contains TS000.LOG, TS001.LOG and
TS002.LOG, then TS003.LOG will be created. If all the logs on the SD
card are deleted, it will start from TS000.LOG again.

The reason for having only 3-digit number is that the underneath
filesystem only support at most 512 files in one single folder.

Log file format
===============

A sample of the log file content:

Start, End, Duration
4081, 14545, 10464
21035, 44065, 23030

It's an ordinary CSV (comma-seperated values) file. The first line
contains the column names. The following lines are the actual
data. Each line represents a unique user activity (more on this in the
next section.) The first column is the starting time of this user
activity. The second column is ending time of this user activity. The
third column is the duration of this user activity (ending time -
starting time.) The unit of these columns are all in milliseconds
since the system boot up.

So for the above example, the first user activity started approximately
at 0:04.1 and ended at 0:14.5, lasted about 10 seconds. The second
user activity started at 0:21 and ended at 0:44.1, lasted for 23 seconds.

User activity
=============

An user activity is defined as a consecutive of interactions between
the user and the touch panel. An interaction is defined as when the
user touch the touch panel or when the user remove the hand from the
touch panel. For an interaction to be considered as consecutive, it
must be initiated within 5 seconds after the audio of the previous
interaction ends.

The starting time of an user activity is at the time of the first
interaction. The ending time of an user activity is at the time of the
last interaction, not at the time when the audio ends or 5 seconds
after that.

The following time line will produce the sample log file in the
previous section.

|    |  |> User A removes hand from panel at 0:06
|    |> User A touchs panel at 0:04
|> System boot up at 0:00
